    > **NOTE:** As of July 2, 2026 -- Usage caps for cost centers is available in the API only at this point -- UI will likely be available mid to late July.

    > **TIP:**: Cost center AI credit pools do not reserve credits per user, they limit a cost center’s draw from the shared enterprise AI Credit pool based on attributed licenses. This feature works best when every licensed user is in a cost center, and should ideally be enabled at the beginning of the month since changes only apply going forward.
