### Custom Usage Dashboards

Export your usage via the GHCP API (must be a Billing admin...), then import that data into these custom PBIs and create your own dashboards.

    > The main focus of the article is the "agentic workflow" and how can they reduce token usage there. One of the options discussed is to limit the number of MCP servers because all that info is put into the system prompt every time, consuming tokens parsing that prompt every time, so they replaced some of those with straight CLI calls. Another topic was how not all tokens are the same because of the cost per model, so they use an "Effective Tokens" formula to normalize consumption. If you see 1M tokens consumed, it's important to know which model used those tokens because Opus costs 25x more than Haiku.
